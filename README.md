# Question-3
Arngren Website Redesign (Adobe XD)
A complete Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) redesign of the original **Arngren** website, focusing on usability, visual hierarchy, navigation clarity, and modern interface principles.  
This project was created using **Adobe XD** and includes wireframes, high-fidelity screens, prototype links, and a full heuristic evaluation.


 Overview
The original **Arngren** website is widely known for its extremely cluttered layout, lack of structure, inconsistent visual hierarchy, and overall poor usability.

This redesign project improves:

- Navigation clarity  
- Visual layout and spacing  
- Product categorization  
- Information architecture  
- Interaction flow  
- Accessibility  
- Aesthetic and minimalist design  

The redesigned version includes **three complete screens**:

1. **Homepage**  
2. **Product Listing Page (Catalog)**  
3. **Product Details Page**

Objectives
- Apply **Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics**  
- Improve usability and structure  
- Build a clean, modern UI with proper spacing, colors, and hierarchy  
- Create reusable UI components  
- Implement a working **interactive prototype**  
- Provide before/after comparison  
- Demonstrate understanding of HCI principles  

Screens Included
All screens were created in **Adobe XD**, using 1920×1080 artboards.

 Homepage
 - Featured categories  
- Featured products grid  
- Navigation header  
- Footer  

Product Listing Page
- Sidebar filters (categories, brands, prices)  
- 2-row product grid  
- Reusable product cards  
- Consistent layout  

Product Details Page
- Large product image  
- Title, price, description  
- Specifications  
- Buy Now button  
  - Consistent header navigation  


Interaction & Prototype Flow
Prototype Mode was used to link all screens:

Navigation Flow
- **Home → Product Listing** (via "Products" or "Categories")  
- **Product Listing → Product Details** (via “View Details”)  
- **Product Details → Home / Listing** (via header links)  

Additional Links
- “About” and “Contact” route back to Homepage (optional placeholder behavior)

#Heuristic Evaluation (Summary)
Before the redesign, Arngren violated multiple usability heuristics:

| Heuristic | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Aesthetic & Minimalist Design | Excessive clutter, no spacing |
| Consistency & Standards | Random fonts, colors, layouts |
| Recognition vs Recall | No categories, no structure |
| Flexibility | No search, no filters |
| Navigation / Visibility | No clear menu, chaotic structure |
| Error Prevention | Overlapping elements, unclear links |

Wireframes Included
Low-fidelity wireframes show the redesigned layout:

- Homepage structure  
- Featured categories  
- Product listing grid  
- Product details layout
